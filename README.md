# Simplified PayPal Application
An implementation of a web-based, multi-user payment service using Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) technologies. The system is a much-simplified version of PayPal. Through a JSF-based web interface, users are be able to send money to other registered users (e.g. using their registered email address as their unique identifier), request money from other registered users and manage their own account (e.g. look at their recent transactions). Super-users (i.e. admins) are be able to access all user accounts and transactions.
